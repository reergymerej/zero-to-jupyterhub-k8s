Zero to JupyterHub
==================

`JupyterHub`_ is a tool that allows you to quickly utilize cloud computing
infrastructure to manage a hub that enables users to interact remotely
with a computing environment that you specify. JupyterHub offers a useful way
to standardize the computing environment of a group of people (e.g.,
for a class of students), as well as allowing people to access the
hub remotely.

This growing collection of information will help you set up your own
JupyterHub instance. It is in an early stage, so the information and
tools may change quickly. If you see anything that is incorrect or have any
questions, feel free to reach out at the `issues page`_.
